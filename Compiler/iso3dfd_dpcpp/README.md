# ISO3DFD sample
ISO3DFD: IntelÂ® oneAPI DPC++ Language Basics Using 3D-Finite-Difference-Wave
Propagation

ISO3DFD is a finite difference stencil kernel for solving the 3D acoustic
isotropic wave equation which can be used as a proxy for propogating a seismic wave. 
Kernels in this sample are implemented as 16th order
in space, with symmetric coefficients, and 2nd order in time scheme without boundary conditions.. 
Using Data Parallel C++, the sample can explicitly run on the GPU and/or CPU to
propagate a seismic wave which is a compute intensive task.  
If successful, the output will print the device name
where the DPC++ code ran along with the grid computation metrics - flops
and effective throughput
